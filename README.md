It is necessary to make your forked copy equal with the original repository:

$ git push origin main

This command pushes the code to your forked repository on Github. The origin is the remote pointing to your forked repository on github.

Create a new branch for a feature or bugfix

All repositories have a main branch. You should establish a new branch and go to work on the issue:

$ git checkout -b <feature-branch> 

This will create a new branch out of master branch. Now start working on the problem and commit your changes.

$ git add --all $ 

git commit -m "<commit message>" 

The first command adds all the files. You can add specific files by removing -a and adding the file names. 

The second command gives a message to your changes so you can know in future what changes this commit makes.

Push your new branch to your remote github fork:

$ git push origin <feature-branch>
